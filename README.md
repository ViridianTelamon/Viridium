# Viridium

Viridium is a web browser made in Python with PyQt5 and I worked on this project from December 21 2021 to March 28 2024 and it was one of my first python projects and it helped me learn a lot about it and it is a finished project now, I came up with the name Viridium when I started the project from Viridian and Chromium it is Viridian and Chromium becuase Chromium is what PyQt5 uses for a web browser with python, and I made it as well and it was an interesting project to work on as well.  
This project was made and developed by ViridianTelamon (Me).
